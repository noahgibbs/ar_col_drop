== README

This Rails app is a demonstration of a design oddity in ActiveRecord
that high-uptime sites will need to carefully work around.

Some of its practices aren't great, and should not be emulated. For
instance, it creates seed data using migrations rather than db:seed
for ease of reproduction, even though that's a bad practice.

And I hope this goes without saying, but *please* don't put any data
you actually care about into this app.
